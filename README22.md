- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python of GUI, SQL, and NLP, and also learning about Cloud Platform (Google、AWS)
- 💞️ I goal for making an automatic trading robot of cryptocurrency, currency, or even stock, but now I just still learning how to code, wish that I can reach my goal `in five years

# 簡介
## 起家
![before](https://github.com/JulianLee310514065/JulianLee310514065/blob/main/%E6%9B%BE%E7%B6%93.png?raw=true)

大四時同學推薦了我DataCamp這個網路課程，從此開啟了我的程式之路，但是因為DataCamp主要集中在Machine Learning 與 DataProcessing ，所以八邊形只練了其中一邊。
